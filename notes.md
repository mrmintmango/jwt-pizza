# Learning notes

## JWT Pizza code study and debugging

As part of `Deliverable ⓵ Development deployment: JWT Pizza`, start up the application and debug through the code until you understand how it works. During the learning process fill out the following required pieces of information in order to demonstrate that you have successfully completed the deliverable.

| User activity                                       | Frontend component | Backend endpoints | Database SQL |

| Create a store                                      |  franchiseDashboard.tsx <br> createStore.tsx  | /api/franchise/${franchise.id}/store, 'POST', store <br> /api/franchise/${user.id} |  "SELECT userId FROM auth WHERE token=?" <br> "SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email FROM userRole AS ur JOIN user AS u ON u.id=ur.userId WHERE ur.objectId=?

| Create a franchise for t@jwt.com                    |   createFranchise.tsx   |  '/api/franchise', 'POST', franchise <br> And then it gets the franchises -> /api/franchise?page=${page}&limit=${limit}&name=${nameFilter}  | "SELECT userId FROM auth WHERE token=?" <br> "SELECT id, name FROM user WHERE email=?" <br> "INSERT INTO franchise (name) VALUES (?)"  <br> "INSERT INTO userRole (userId, role, objectId) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"   |
